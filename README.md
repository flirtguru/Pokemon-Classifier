# Pokemon-Classifier 


I used a data set from [this](https://github.com/dimart/pokemon_recognition) github repository and instead used a CNN based model for classifying Pok√©mon images I wasnt able to train the model for 50 epochs given the processor i have. As I had a very small dataset i had to do data augmentation.   






## Optimization

My model can further be improved by using  

1)Dropout  

2)Hyper parameter tuning(Grid Search)
